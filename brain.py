In my point of view, I tend to use the group approach more frequently rather than one-to-one communication.
It is possible to note that my network consists of peers, people with business knowledge,
experienced professional, social contacts, and so on.
At the same time, I try to involve people with different background, gender,
ethnicity, and cultural views as I support diversity and understand that it is rather important in today
â€™s globalized world that tends to blur boundaries between different cultures. 
Interestingly, people having different perspectives and backgrounds benefit my experience as I can learn.
